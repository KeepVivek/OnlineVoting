# OnlineVoting
Blockchain based OnlineVoting Project

Application and Framework Used:

•Node Package Manager (NPM) - Node Package Manager, or NPM, which comes with Node.js.
•Truffle Framework – It allows us to build decentralized applications on the Ethereum blockchain. It provides a suite of tools that allow us to write smart contacts with the Solidity programming language.
•Ganache - Ganache, a local in-memory blockchain.
•Metamask - Metamask extension for Google Chrome. In order to use the blockchain, we must connect to it

Steps for running the application

First, open Ganache and run it - it keeps your local blockchain running.
Then open cmd on your system and change the directory to project folder
Write command to migrated contracts: truffle migrate –reset
start development server from the command line : npm run dev
This should automatically open a new browser window with client-side application.
Make sure account is connected to local server in MetaMask
